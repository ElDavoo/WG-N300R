Information about WG-N300R

Wodgreat's WG-N300R is a wireless repeater that is based on OpenWrt. This repos aims at giving a way to me (and subsequently owners of this device) to get root access and maybe sources :)

There are two versions of the firmware on the manufacturer's website. I guess one is if you have changeable antennas and one is for devices where you can't change antenna.

Don't bother contacting manufacturer for source, it's their "technical secret" lol
