WG-N300R firmware

Wodgreat's WG-N300R is a wireless repeater that is based on OpenWrt.

There are two versions of the firmware on the manufacturer's website. I guess one is if you have changeable antennas and one is for devices where you can't change antenna.

Don't bother contacting manufacturer for source, it's their "technical secret" lol
